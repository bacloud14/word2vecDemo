# word2vecDemo

This is a demo application that is using the amazing DeepLearning library `deeplearning4j` on Android. Please read more about deployment of `dl4j` on Android, and why it is tricky and probably would not make it anyway !

It simply tries to learn (word embedding) from a small sentences corpus, and predict similarity between emoji keywords and any input sentence in English.

There are two challenges:

- Exclude unused dependencies as possible.
- Revise the model so it can be more accurate and performant (as any ML algorithm).

# Contribution

Please see open issues for a specific issue, and do not hesitate to open any new issue (like better code, readability, modularity and best practice, performance, Android UI or even functionality enhancements...).

Please know that I am not a keen Android developer not a keen datascientist.

If you contribute, please consider that I can port this to some Android application on Play store, It will be 100% free for Android users on Play store and anywhere, although I can add ads to generate some coffee expenses :)

If you want to maintain the project with me, you can alwayse ask.

Please keep it fair if you want to deploy anywhere, ask for permission.

Sweet coding !
